Exchange bot applications
==========================

The idea of this submodule is to provide the following:
- a common database interface for bots that have state
- a simple CLI to initialize and tear down the state of the bots
- a simple framework/CLI to generate orders for testing using "scenarios"
- some basic bot implementations (market maker and simple alpha examples)
